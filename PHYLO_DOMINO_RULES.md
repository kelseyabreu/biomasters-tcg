# Phylo Domino-Style Ecosystem Building Rules

## 🌿 **GENERAL CONCEPT**

Phylo is played like dominoes, but instead of matching numbers, you match **environmental conditions** and **food relationships**. Cards can connect in **four directions** (unlike dominoes' two ends), creating sprawling ecosystem networks that represent real food chains.

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

Build the strongest, richest, and most diverse ecosystem while competing for points. Biodiversity is your defense against environmental disasters!

## 🃏 **CARD TYPES**

### **SPECIES CARDS**
- **Placement Rule**: Must be adjacent to at least one compatible card
- **Information**: Scale, Foodchain Level, Diet, Terrain, Climate
- **Points**: Based on difficulty to place (rare/complex species = more points)

### **EVENT CARDS**
- **Placement Rule**: Can be played on any compatible species card
- **Effect**: Environmental situations that create domino effects
- **Timing**: Removed before next player's turn (unless specified)

### **HOME CARDS (Starter Cards)**
- **Placement Rule**: Only at game beginning
- **Function**: Any FOODCHAIN #1 species can connect regardless of terrain/climate
- **Setup**: Each player starts with one HOME card adjacent to opponent's

## 🔗 **COMPATIBILITY RULES**

### **Environmental Compatibility**
Cards must share **BOTH**:
- **At least one TERRAIN** (Forest, Ocean, Grassland, etc.)
- **At least one CLIMATE** (Cold, Cool, Warm, Hot)

### **Food Chain Compatibility**
- **FOODCHAIN #1 (Producers)**: Can connect to HOME cards or other producers
- **FOODCHAIN #2 (Herbivores)**: Must connect to producers (#1) or other herbivores
- **FOODCHAIN #3+ (Carnivores)**: Must connect to appropriate prey (lower foodchain levels)

### **Scale Compatibility**
- **Predators** can only eat prey of **equal or smaller scale**
- **Scale 1-10**: Represents relative size (1=tiny, 10=massive)

## 🎮 **GAMEPLAY FLOW**

### **Setup**
1. Each player places their HOME card adjacent to opponent's
2. Shuffle remaining cards into personal decks
3. Draw starting hand (typically 5-7 cards)

### **Turn Structure**
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw one card from your deck
2. **Play Phase**: Place one species card following compatibility rules
3. **Event Phase** (Optional): Play event cards if applicable
4. **End Phase**: Check for win conditions

### **Placement Rules**
- New cards must connect to at least one existing card
- All three compatibility types must be satisfied for at least one connection
- Cards can connect on any of their four sides

## 🏆 **SCORING SYSTEM**

### **Placement Difficulty Points**
- **Base Points**: Each card's inherent point value
- **Foodchain Bonus**: Higher foodchain levels = more points
- **Scale Bonus**: Larger creatures = more points
- **Conservation Bonus**: Endangered species = significant bonus
- **Connection Bonus**: More adjacent connections = more points

### **Ecosystem Network Points**
- **Chain Length**: Longer food chains = exponential bonus
- **Biodiversity**: Variety of terrains, climates, foodchain levels
- **Stability**: Well-connected, balanced ecosystems
- **Complete Chains**: Bonus for owning entire food chains

### **Special Bonuses**
- **Conservation Victory**: Successfully placing 5+ endangered species
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Bonus points for correct biological knowledge
- **Event Survival**: Ecosystems that survive environmental disasters

## 🌪️ **EVENT SYSTEM**

### **Environmental Events**
- **Climate Change**: Forces migration or removal of cold-adapted species
- **Deforestation**: Destroys forest habitats and food sources
- **Ocean Acidification**: Collapses marine food webs
- **Invasive Species**: Disrupts native species connections

### **Natural Disasters**
- **Volcanic Eruption**: Indiscriminate habitat destruction
- **Drought**: Affects water-dependent species
- **Wildfire**: Destroys terrestrial ecosystems

### **Conservation Events**
- **Protected Areas**: Helps endangered species survive
- **Breeding Programs**: Increases resilience of rare species
- **Habitat Restoration**: Repairs damaged ecosystems

## 🎯 **WIN CONDITIONS**

### **Point Victory** (Most Common)
- Highest total points when game ends
- Combines placement difficulty + ecosystem network + bonuses

### **Conservation Victory** (Special)
- Successfully place and maintain 5+ endangered species
- Achieve 40+ conservation bonus points
- Ecosystem must remain stable

### **Ecosystem Dominance** (Rare)
- Control the largest stable ecosystem network
- Maintain highest biodiversity score
- Survive major environmental events

### **Scientific Accuracy** (Challenge Mode)
- Win scientific challenges about species facts
- Accumulate knowledge-based bonus points
- Demonstrate real biological understanding

## 🧬 **SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY**

### **Challenge System**
Players can challenge biological claims:
- **Habitat Claims**: "This species doesn't live in that terrain"
- **Diet Claims**: "This species doesn't eat that food type"
- **Scale Claims**: "This species isn't that size"
- **Behavior Claims**: "This species doesn't have that ability"

### **Evidence Requirements**
- Provide scientific evidence for challenges
- Reference real biological data
- Time limit for responses (60 seconds)

### **Resolution**
- **Upheld Challenge**: Challenger gains points, target loses points
- **Failed Challenge**: Challenger loses points, target gains points
- **Inconclusive**: No point changes

## 🎲 **GAME END CONDITIONS**

### **Deck Exhaustion**
- When any player runs out of cards
- Calculate final scores immediately

### **Time Limit** (Optional)
- Set time limit for competitive play
- Highest score when time expires

### **Ecosystem Collapse**
- If ecosystem stability drops below 20%
- All players lose (environmental message)

### **Voluntary End**
- Players agree to end game
- Calculate scores at current state

## 🌟 **STRATEGY TIPS**

### **Early Game**
- Focus on establishing stable base ecosystem
- Prioritize producers and primary consumers
- Build foundation for future expansion

### **Mid Game**
- Add biodiversity for bonus points
- Create multiple food chain branches
- Prepare defenses against events

### **Late Game**
- Optimize point-scoring placements
- Protect valuable endangered species
- Use events strategically against opponents

### **Advanced Strategy**
- **Ecosystem Resilience**: Build redundant food pathways
- **Point Efficiency**: Balance difficulty vs. reward
- **Event Prediction**: Anticipate and prepare for disasters
- **Scientific Knowledge**: Learn real biology for challenge advantages

## 📚 **EDUCATIONAL VALUE**

### **Real Biology Learning**
- All species data based on scientific research
- Accurate habitat and diet information
- Conservation status awareness
- Ecosystem relationship understanding

### **Critical Thinking**
