# Phylo Card Movement System Guide

## üèÉ **MOVEMENT OVERVIEW**

In Phylo, certain species have **movement capabilities** that allow them to reposition on the ecosystem board after being placed. This represents real animal behaviors like migration, territorial expansion, and habitat adaptation.

## üéØ **MOVEMENT TYPES**

### **MOVE (Terrestrial Movement)**
- **Range**: 1-4 spaces based on species mobility
- **Path**: Must move through compatible terrain
- **Restrictions**: Cannot cross incompatible habitats
- **Examples**: Wolves (MOVE 3), Deer (MOVE 2), Bears (MOVE 2)

### **FLIGHT (Aerial Movement)**
- **Range**: 1-6 spaces based on flying ability
- **Path**: Can fly over any terrain (ignores ground obstacles)
- **Restrictions**: Must land on compatible habitat
- **Examples**: Eagles (FLIGHT 4), Hummingbirds (FLIGHT 3), Bats (FLIGHT 2)

### **SWIM (Aquatic Movement)**
- **Range**: 1-5 spaces in water bodies
- **Path**: Must follow connected water systems
- **Restrictions**: Cannot cross land barriers
- **Examples**: Salmon (SWIM 4), Dolphins (SWIM 5), Turtles (SWIM 2)

### **BURROW (Underground Movement)**
- **Range**: 1-3 spaces underground
- **Path**: Can tunnel under surface obstacles
- **Restrictions**: Must emerge in compatible soil/terrain
- **Examples**: Moles (BURROW 3), Prairie Dogs (BURROW 2), Worms (BURROW 1)

## üîÑ **MOVEMENT MECHANICS**

### **When Can You Move?**
- **During Your Turn**: After placing a new card (optional)
- **Event Response**: When environmental events force migration
- **Strategic Repositioning**: To optimize ecosystem connections
- **Escape Mechanism**: To avoid predation or habitat loss

### **Movement Validation**
1. **Range Check**: Species can only move within their movement value
2. **Path Validation**: Route must be traversable for movement type
3. **Destination Check**: Landing spot must be environmentally compatible
4. **Connection Maintenance**: Movement cannot break essential food chains

### **Movement Costs**
- **Free Movement**: Once per turn during your play phase
- **Emergency Movement**: Costs 1 point when responding to events
- **Multiple Movements**: Each additional move costs 2 points
- **Forced Movement**: No cost when required by event cards

## üåç **TERRAIN INTERACTIONS**

### **Forest Terrain**
- **MOVE**: Easy passage for most terrestrial species
- **FLIGHT**: Clear airspace above canopy
- **SWIM**: Blocked unless rivers/streams present
- **BURROW**: Rich soil allows easy tunneling

### **Ocean Terrain**
- **MOVE**: Impossible for terrestrial species
- **FLIGHT**: Can fly over but cannot land
- **SWIM**: Optimal environment for aquatic species
- **BURROW**: Impossible in deep water

### **Mountain Terrain**
- **MOVE**: Difficult, reduces range by 1
- **FLIGHT**: Excellent for aerial species
- **SWIM**: Only in mountain lakes/streams
- **BURROW**: Rocky soil, reduces range by 1

### **Grassland Terrain**
- **MOVE**: Optimal for running species
- **FLIGHT**: Open airspace, good visibility
- **SWIM**: Limited to rivers and ponds
- **BURROW**: Soft soil, ideal for burrowing

### **Desert Terrain**
- **MOVE**: Harsh conditions, reduces range by 1
- **FLIGHT**: Thermals provide lift bonuses
- **SWIM**: Extremely limited water sources
- **BURROW**: Sand allows easy digging

### **Urban Terrain**
- **MOVE**: Obstacles reduce range by 1
- **FLIGHT**: Buildings create navigation challenges
- **SWIM**: Polluted waterways reduce effectiveness
- **BURROW**: Concrete prevents most burrowing

## üéÆ **STRATEGIC MOVEMENT**

### **Ecosystem Optimization**
- **Chain Building**: Move species to create longer food chains
- **Biodiversity**: Spread species across different terrains
- **Stability**: Position keystone species for maximum ecosystem support
- **Defense**: Create redundant pathways against event disruption

### **Predator-Prey Dynamics**
- **Hunting**: Predators can move to reach new prey
- **Escape**: Prey species can flee from predators
- **Ambush**: Position predators near prey migration routes
- **Territory**: Establish and defend feeding territories

### **Environmental Adaptation**
- **Climate Migration**: Move species to suitable climate zones
- **Seasonal Movement**: Represent migration patterns
- **Habitat Expansion**: Colonize new suitable territories
- **Resource Following**: Track food and water availability

## üå™Ô∏è **EVENT-TRIGGERED MOVEMENT**

### **Climate Change Events**
- **Forced Migration**: Species must move to suitable climates
- **Range Shifts**: Permanent changes to habitat preferences
- **Adaptation Pressure**: Move or face removal from game
- **Corridor Creation**: Establish migration pathways

### **Habitat Destruction**
- **Emergency Evacuation**: Immediate movement required
- **Refugee Populations**: Temporary overcrowding in safe areas
- **Habitat Restoration**: Return movement when areas recover
- **Alternative Habitats**: Find substitute environments

### **Human Development**
- **Fragmentation**: Movement restricted by barriers
- **Urban Adaptation**: Some species adapt to city life
- **Wildlife Corridors**: Special movement paths created
- **Conservation Areas**: Protected movement zones

## üèÜ **MOVEMENT SCORING**

### **Movement Bonuses**
- **Successful Migration**: +2 points for reaching better habitat
- **Predator Efficiency**: +1 point for successful hunt via movement
- **Ecosystem Connection**: +3 points for linking isolated areas
- **Conservation Success**: +5 points for endangered species survival

### **Movement Penalties**
- **Failed Movement**: -1 point for movement to incompatible habitat
- **Ecosystem Disruption**: -2 points for breaking food chains
- **Overcrowding**: -1 point for moving to oversaturated areas
- **Unnatural Movement**: -3 points for scientifically inaccurate moves

## üß¨ **SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY**

### **Real Animal Behaviors**
- **Migration Patterns**: Seasonal movements based on real species
- **Dispersal Distances**: Movement ranges reflect actual capabilities
- **Habitat Requirements**: Destination compatibility based on biology
- **Movement Triggers**: Events that cause real animal movements

### **Educational Opportunities**
- **Conservation Corridors**: Learn about wildlife movement needs
- **Climate Adaptation**: Understand species responses to change
- **Habitat Connectivity**: Appreciate ecosystem fragmentation issues
- **Species Interactions**: See how movement affects predator-prey dynamics

## üéØ **ADVANCED MOVEMENT STRATEGIES**

### **Multi-Species Coordination**
- **Pack Movement**: Move related species together
- **Symbiotic Relationships**: Coordinate movements of mutualistic species
- **Competitive Exclusion**: Use movement to outcompete rivals
- **Facilitation**: Help other species through movement assistance

### **Temporal Strategies**
- **Timing**: Move at optimal moments in game progression
- **Anticipation**: Position for future event responses
- **Patience**: Wait for better movement opportunities
- **Pressure**: Force opponent movements through strategic positioning

### **Risk Management**
- **Backup Plans**: Maintain multiple movement options
- **Safe Zones**: Identify secure areas for retreat
- **Escape Routes**: Plan movement paths for emergencies
- **Redundancy**: Don't rely on single movement strategies
