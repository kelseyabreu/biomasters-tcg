# Phylo Scientific Accuracy & Challenge System

## üß¨ **SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION**

Phylo is built on **real biological data** and **scientific accuracy**. Every species card contains factual information about habitat, diet, behavior, and conservation status. The challenge system rewards players for biological knowledge while maintaining game balance.

## üéØ **CHALLENGE SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

Players can **challenge** biological claims made by opponents, creating opportunities for education and strategic gameplay. Successful challenges reward scientific knowledge, while failed challenges penalize guessing.

## üî¨ **CHALLENGE CATEGORIES**

### **üè† HABITAT CHALLENGES**
**Challenge**: "This species doesn't live in that terrain/climate"

**Valid Challenges**:
- Polar bear in tropical climate
- Desert cactus in ocean terrain
- Deep-sea fish in freshwater
- Arctic fox in hot climate

**Evidence Required**:
- Geographic range maps
- Climate tolerance data
- Habitat preference studies
- Conservation status reports

**Example**: *"Penguins cannot survive in hot climates because they lack heat dissipation mechanisms and require cold water for feeding."*

### **üçΩÔ∏è DIET CHALLENGES**
**Challenge**: "This species doesn't eat that food type"

**Valid Challenges**:
- Herbivore eating meat
- Carnivore eating plants (except omnivores)
- Filter feeder eating large prey
- Specialist feeder eating wrong food

**Evidence Required**:
- Stomach content studies
- Feeding behavior observations
- Nutritional requirement data
- Digestive system anatomy

**Example**: *"Koalas cannot eat general vegetation because they have specialized digestive systems for eucalyptus leaves only."*

### **üìè SCALE CHALLENGES**
**Challenge**: "This species isn't that size relative to others"

**Valid Challenges**:
- Incorrect size relationships
- Predator smaller than prey
- Unrealistic scale comparisons
- Developmental stage confusion

**Evidence Required**:
- Body size measurements
- Weight comparisons
- Growth rate data
- Sexual dimorphism studies

**Example**: *"A hummingbird cannot be larger than an eagle - hummingbirds weigh 2-20g while eagles weigh 3-7kg."*

### **üèÉ BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES**
**Challenge**: "This species doesn't have that ability/behavior"

**Valid Challenges**:
- Incorrect movement capabilities
- Wrong social behaviors
- Impossible physiological abilities
- Inaccurate life cycle stages

**Evidence Required**:
- Behavioral studies
- Physiological research
- Movement tracking data
- Social structure observations

**Example**: *"Elephants cannot fly because they lack the necessary anatomical adaptations for flight."*

### **üõ°Ô∏è CONSERVATION CHALLENGES**
**Challenge**: "This species has incorrect conservation status"

**Valid Challenges**:
- Outdated IUCN status
- Regional vs. global status confusion
- Subspecies status differences
- Recent status changes

**Evidence Required**:
- IUCN Red List data
- Population trend studies
- Conservation action plans
- Recent assessment updates

**Example**: *"The California condor is Critically Endangered, not Least Concern, with only ~500 individuals remaining."*
