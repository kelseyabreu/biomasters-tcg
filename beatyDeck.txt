PHYLO: The Trading Card Game celebrates ecosystems in all their awesomeness. It showcases the many wonderful, weird, and wacky species that live on our planet Earth. It also deals

ECOSYSTEMS are communities of species who interact with one another and interact with
IKWUUWVMV^QZWVUMV\)VMV^QZWVUMV\Q[LMÅVMLJaQ\[TERRAIN and CLIMATE. When
many different species make up a particular ecosystem, we say that the ecosystem is rich in
BIODIVERSITY. Biodiversity is a good thing because it makes ecosystems more stable and
resilient to threats.
The PHYLO Ecosystem Game allows players to use their PHYLO cards to build food chains,
create stable ecosystems, sabotage opponents’ ecosystems, and rack up points in the process.

THIS IS A PHYLO CARD!
Age: 8 years old and up.
Game Duration: Approximately 20-30 minutes
Number of players: 2
Deck Requirements: Each player will need a deck of about 20 to 25
cards, which should include one HOME card each, as well as a mixture
of SPECIES and EVENT cards. These decks you can build yourself, or
you can use a “starter” deck such as the one you have bought (or one
of several that you can download at phylogame.org) . For these “startMZºLMKS[aW]KIV\ISMW]\\PM\_W075-KIZL[IVL[P]NÆM\PMZM[\
between the two players.
Quick Instructions: Two players sit across from one another at a table.
At the start of the game, each player places his or her HOME card on the
table. HOME cards should be placed adjacent to one another, facing in
opposite directions (see right). Each player’s remaining cards must be
kept face-down in a pile (called the PICK-UP pile). Players should also
reserve a spot on the table for their discarded cards (called the DISCARD
pile).
Players draw 5 cards from their respective PICK-UP piles to form their
hand. The PHYLO Ecosystem Game is played in turns, and players may
XTIaZWKSXIXMZ[KQ[[WZ[\WLM\MZUQVM_PW_QTTOWÅZ[\
On each turn, a player will draw 1 new card from their PICK UP pile and
may take 3 of the following ACTIONS (any combination):
Playing a Card: It is important that players continue to place their own
cards on the table “facing them” (and opposite to their opponent). This
allows players to keep track of their own cards. Note that players may
play cards adjacent to both their own or their opponent’s cards.
SPECIES cards may only be placed next to cards which share at least
ONE common CLIMATE and ONE common TERRAIN. Species which
share a common CLIMATE and TERRAIN are said to be environmentally
COMPATIBLE.
SPECIES cards must also be foodchain COMPATIBLE. FOODCHAIN#1
cards can be played anywhere, so long as they are placed in an environmentally COMPATIBLE manner. Note that any FOODCHAIN#1 card may
be played adjacent to a HOME card.
In general, FOODCHAIN#2 cards (a herbivore for instance) must be
placed adjacent to at least one FOODCHAIN#1 card. FOODCHAIN#3
cards which are carnivores (meat-eating, as indicated by a red circle)
may be played next to at least one FOODCHAIN#2 prey of equal or smallMZ;+)4-QMQ\KIV¼\MI\[WUM\PQVOJQOOMZ\PIVQ\[MTN]VTM[[[XMKQÅMLQV
the card text). Omnivores (FOODCHAIN#3, brown circle) may be played
next to SPECIES which are FOODCHAIN#2 (meat) or FOODCHAIN#1
(plant). It’s also a good idea to read the card text (especially if the diet is
IJTIKSKQZKTMI[[XMKQÅKQV[\Z]K\QWV[ZMOIZLQVO.77,+0)16KWVVMKtions may be provided (i.e. the organism has exceptional diet needs).
EVENT cards may be played as directed by instructions on the card.
=VTM[[W\PMZ_Q[M[XMKQÅML->-6<KIZL[\ISMQUUMLQI\MMNNMK\IVLIZM
then removed from the table and placed in the DISCARD pile.
EVENT cards will often result in cards that are INCOMPATIBLE to all
adjacent cards (i.e. no shared CLIMATES or TERRAINS, and no proper
FOODCHAIN connection). If so, the affected player has only their next
turn (i.e. next 3 ACTIONS) to react to an EVENT before any of these
newly INCOMPATIBLE SPECIES cards are removed. These players may
choose actions to play new cards that replenish broken food chains,
and/or MOVE affected cards to COMPATIBLE areas on the table. Any
cards that cannot be saved after this reaction turn must be placed in the
DISCARD pile.
Moving a Card: MOVE# (located in the card text) indicates how many
places a species may move per action. Species can be moved up, down,
left, or right, and must be played in an open spot, adjacent to at least one
other COMPATIBLE card on the table. Birds, insects, and other organisms that travel by FLIGHT may also move along a diagonal path. Like
before with EVENT cards, any card made INCOMPATIBLE due to a MOVE
is only discarded if the card is still INCOMPATIBLE after the affected
player has been given his/her turn to react.
Ending the Game: When a player picks up his/her last card from their
81+3̉=8XQTM\PMV\PI\XTIaMZ_QTTÅVQ[PPQ[PMZ\]ZVIVL\PMQZWXXWnent will then also play their one last turn. At that point, the game ends,
UNLESS an EVENT card or a MOVE is played resulting in INCOMPATIBLE cards during that last turn – essentially, when this happens, the other player always has the right to react by getting one extra turn. In the
end, players will then add up all points that remain on the table: player
with the most points wins.
Keywords: Note that some cards will have special keywords. These can
be ignored or played as described at the website’s glossary (phylogame.
org/glossary). For instance, the INVASIVE keyword, allows a player to
play a card directly on top of (and thereby discard) a similar SPECIES
card.
Optional Rule: Sometimes, cards which are compatible in the game are not actually compatible in real life. This might be because, despite sharing compatible terrains and climates,
species may actually live in different areas of the world. As well, some species may have
highly specialized diets and eat only a limited selection of things in the wild.
Because of this, some players choose to include a CHALLENGE or “call your bluff” rule.
With this rule, players may challenge strange or questionable SPECIES connections (just as
one would challenge a misspelled word in Scrabble). We recommend using Wikipedia (www.
wikipedia.org) or the Encyclopaedia of Life (www.eol.org) to verify real-world species
compatibility.
The player that wins the “call your bluff” CHALLENGE may subsequently remove any card
from the table with immediate consequences. For more gameplay options, check out our
website at www.phylogame.org!
- PLAY a card from your hand onto the table (SPECIES or
EVENT card - see Playing a Card).
- DROP one card from your hand into a DISCARD PILE and
PICK UP three new cards.
- MOVE a SPECIES card (see Moving a Card).
- PASSING (essentially to end their turn).
