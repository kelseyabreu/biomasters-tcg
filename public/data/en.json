  "CardAbilitiesText": {
    "1": "[WATERSHED PREDATOR] (Action): Exhaust this card. Target one [AQUATIC] creature adjacent to an [AMPHIBIOUS] card that this Bear is also adjacent to. Exhaust that target.",
    "2": "[APEX PREDATOR] (Action): Exhaust this card. Target an adjacent +3C or +4C creature. It becomes Exhausted.",
